Jabber-SH
=========

Jabber-SH — SH console via XMPP/Jabber (GTalk)

Jabber-SH allows you to administrate a remote computer via a command line 
through a Jabber client. It’s like SSH via GoogleTalk! :)
This is just a hack but it might be usefull sometime to run basic commands
on a machine that is not accessible via ssh.
